"""
Minkowski Portal Refinement (MPR) collision detection algorithm.

This module implements the MPR algorithm for detecting collisions between convex shapes
and computing signed distance and contact information. MPR is an alternative to the
GJK+EPA approach that can be more efficient for penetrating contacts.

The algorithm works by:
1. Constructing an initial portal (triangle) in Minkowski space that contains the origin
2. Iteratively refining the portal by moving it closer to the origin
3. Computing signed distance and contact points once the origin is enclosed

Key features:
- Works directly with penetrating contacts (no need for EPA as a separate step)
- More numerically stable than EPA for deep penetrations
- Returns collision normal, signed distance, and witness points

The implementation uses support mapping to query shape geometry, making it applicable
to any convex shape that provides a support function.

        Compute geometric center of Minkowski difference.

        Used by MPR and GJK as the initial interior point ``v0`` of the
        Minkowski difference.  A poor ``v0`` — far outside one of the
        shapes — is a known cause of MPR portal degeneracy when the
        partner is a thin/flat primitive (e.g. a single mesh triangle),
        because the chosen ray direction can produce supports that all
        collapse onto a single vertex of the partner.

        For most primitives the local origin is already a sensible
        interior point, but for ``CONVEX_MESH`` (an arbitrary convex
        hull) the authoring origin is not guaranteed to lie inside the
        hull — many assets place hulls far from their body frame.  For
        those shapes we compute the AABB of the (scaled) hull vertices
        on the fly and use the AABB center, which is always inside the
        hull's bounding box and typically very close to the hull
        interior.

        For triangles (and triangle prisms) on shape A the center on
        shape A is replaced by the closest point on the triangle to
        shape B's center (using the freshly computed B center), giving
        MPR and GJK a much better starting point when the triangle is
        large relative to the convex.
