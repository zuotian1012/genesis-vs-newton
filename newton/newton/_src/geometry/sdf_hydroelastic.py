"""SDF-based hydroelastic contact generation.

This module implements hydroelastic contact modeling between shapes represented
by Signed Distance Fields (SDFs). Hydroelastic contacts model compliant surfaces
where contact force is distributed over a contact patch rather than point contacts.

**Pipeline Overview:**

1. **Broadphase**: OBB intersection tests between SDF shape pairs
2. **Octree Refinement**: Hierarchical subdivision (8x8x8 → 4x4x4 → 2x2x2 → voxels)
   to find iso-voxels where the zero-isosurface between SDFs exists
3. **Marching Cubes**: Extract contact surface triangles from iso-voxels
4. **Contact Generation**: Generate contacts at triangle centroids with force
   proportional to penetration depth and surface area
5. **Contact Reduction**: Reduce contacts via ``HydroelasticContactReduction``

**Usage:**

Configure shapes with ``ShapeConfig(is_hydroelastic=True, kh=1e9)`` and
pass :class:`HydroelasticSDF.Config` to the collision pipeline.

class HydroelasticSDF:
    """Hydroelastic contact generation with SDF-based collision detection.

    .. experimental::

        ``HydroelasticSDF`` and the underlying SDF storage on
        :class:`~newton.Model` may change without notice.

    This class implements hydroelastic contact modeling between shapes represented
    by Signed Distance Fields (SDFs). It uses an octree-based broadphase to identify
    potentially colliding regions, then applies marching cubes to extract the
    zero-isosurface where both SDFs intersect. Contact points are generated at
    triangle centroids on this isosurface, with contact forces proportional to
    penetration depth and represented area.

    The collision pipeline consists of:
        1. Broadphase: Identifies overlapping OBBs of SDF between shape pairs
        2. Octree refinement: Hierarchically subdivides blocks to find iso-voxels
        3. Marching cubes: Extracts contact surface triangles from iso-voxels
        4. Contact generation: Computes contact points, normals, depths, and areas
        5. Optional contact reduction: Bins and reduces contacts per shape pair

    Args:
        num_shape_pairs: Maximum number of hydroelastic shape pairs to process.
        total_num_tiles: Total number of SDF blocks across all hydroelastic shapes.
        max_num_blocks_per_shape: Maximum block count for any single shape.
        shape_material_kh: Hydroelastic stiffness coefficient for each shape.
        n_shapes: Total number of shapes in the simulation.
        config: Configuration options controlling buffer sizes, contact reduction,
            and other behavior. Defaults to :class:`HydroelasticSDF.Config`.
        device: Warp device for GPU computation.
        writer_func: Callback for writing decoded contact data.

    Note:
        Instances are typically created internally by the collision pipeline
        (via :meth:`~newton.Model.collide`) rather than constructed directly.
        The pipeline automatically extracts the required SDF data and shape
        information from the simulation :class:`~newton.Model`.

        Contact IDs are packed into 32-bit integers using 9 bits per voxel axis coordinate.
        For SDF grids larger than 512 voxels per axis, contact ID collisions may occur,
        which can affect contact matching accuracy for warm-starting physics solvers.
