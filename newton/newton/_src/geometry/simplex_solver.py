"""
Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) algorithm with simplex solver for collision detection.

This module implements the GJK distance algorithm, which computes the minimum distance
between two convex shapes. GJK operates on the Minkowski difference of the shapes and
iteratively builds a simplex (1-4 vertices) that either contains the origin (indicating
collision) or gets progressively closer to it (for distance computation).

The algorithm works by:
1. Building a simplex in Minkowski space using support mapping
2. Finding the point on the simplex closest to the origin
3. Computing a new search direction toward the origin
4. Iterating until convergence or collision detection

Key features:
- Distance computation between separated shapes
- Collision detection when shapes overlap (returns signed_distance = 0)
- Barycentric coordinates (stored as vec4) for witness points
- Numerically stable simplex reduction using Johnson's distance subalgorithm

The implementation uses support mapping to query shape geometry, making it applicable
to any convex shape that provides a support function.

    Factory function to create GJK distance solver with specific support and center functions.

    Storage Convention for Simplex Vertices (Mat83f):
    ------------------------------------------------
    The simplex stores up to 4 vertices in a flat array where each vertex uses 2 consecutive vec3 slots:
    - v[2*i]     stores B (point on shape B)
    - v[2*i + 1] stores BtoA (vector from B to A, i.e., the Minkowski difference A - B)

    This storage scheme allows:
    - Direct access to the Minkowski difference (BtoA) which is used in most GJK operations
    - Efficient reconstruction of point A when needed: A = B + BtoA
    - Reduced function call overhead compared to wrapping field access in functions

    Args:
        support_func: Support mapping function for shapes.
        _support_funcs: Pre-built support functions tuple from
            :func:`create_support_map_function`. When provided, these are reused
            instead of creating new ones, allowing multiple solvers to share
            compiled support code.

    Returns:
        ``solve_closest_distance`` wrapper function.  The core function is
        available as ``solve_closest_distance.core`` for callers that want to
        handle the relative-frame transform themselves.
