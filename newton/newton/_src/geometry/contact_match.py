"""Frame-to-frame contact matching via binary search on sorted contact keys.

Given the previous frame's sorted contacts (keys, world-space midpoints,
normals) and the current frame's unsorted contacts, this module finds
correspondences using the deterministic sort key from
:func:`~newton._src.geometry.contact_data.make_contact_sort_key`.

For each new contact the matcher binary-searches the previous frame's
sorted keys for the ``(shape_a, shape_b)`` pair range — ignoring the
``sort_sub_key`` bits — then picks the closest previous contact in that
range whose normal also passes the dot-product threshold.  "Closest" is
measured in world space between the contact *midpoints*
``0.5 * (world(point0) + world(point1))``, i.e. symmetric in shape 0 and
shape 1.  The result is a per-contact match index:

- ``>= 0``: index of the matched contact in the previous frame's sorted buffer.
- ``MATCH_NOT_FOUND (-1)``: shape pair has no prior contacts.
- ``MATCH_BROKEN (-2)``: shape pair exists but no contact within
  position/normal thresholds, *or* a closer new contact won the same
  prev contact in the uniqueness resolve pass.

Why ignore sort_sub_key
-----------------------
Multi-contact manifolds (e.g. box-box face-face) can rotate the
``sort_sub_key`` assignment across frames when their internal generation
order shifts (e.g. the Sutherland-Hodgman clip's starting vertex moves
by one slot), even though the physical contact points stay essentially
in place.  Matching on the full key would mark these contacts broken
every frame.  Pair counts are small (a few manifold points per pair),
so the linear scan inside the pair range is cheap.

One-to-one match via packed atomic_min
--------------------------------------
A pair-range scan can have multiple new contacts pick the same prev
contact as their closest.  To keep the mapping injective without
sorting or CAS retries, the matcher uses a single ``wp.atomic_min`` per
new contact on a per-prev ``int64`` claim word:

    claim = (float_flip(dist_sq) << 32) | (sort_key & 0xFFFFFFFF)

``float_flip`` reinterprets the non-negative ``dist_sq`` as a
sortable ``uint32``, so the high 32 bits order claims by ascending
distance; the low 32 bits hold the low 32 bits of the new contact's
sort key (which uniquely identify it within its shape pair), breaking
ties deterministically.  Using the sort key rather than the
``wp.tid()`` of the new contact keeps the winner invariant under the
non-deterministic unsorted slot assignment that the narrow phase gives
us via ``wp.atomic_add`` -- two parallel runs of the same scene that
emit the same set of new contacts in different orders will pick the
same winner.  See :func:`_pack_claim` for the per-pair uniqueness
caveat (multi-contact paths are unique by construction; the global
reduction path is no worse than the upstream deterministic sort).

After the match kernel runs, a small finalize kernel reads
``prev_claim[best_idx]`` and demotes any new contact whose sort-key low
32 bits do not appear in the low bits of the claim word to
:data:`MATCH_BROKEN`.  Losers are *not* re-matched against a
second-closest prev (kept for simplicity and speed).

Cost: one ``int64[capacity]`` buffer, one ``wp.atomic_min`` per new
contact, and one short finalize kernel launch.  No ``atomic_cas``.

Memory efficiency
-----------------
The matcher reuses the :class:`ContactSorter`'s existing scratch buffers
(:attr:`ContactSorter.scratch_pos_world`, :attr:`ContactSorter.scratch_normal`)
to store previous-frame world-space contact midpoints and normals between
frames.  This works for the *match* kernel because matching runs **before**
``ContactSorter.sort_full``, so the scratch buffers still hold the previous
frame's saved data; ``save_sorted_state`` runs **after** sorting and
refreshes them in-place for the next frame.  The only additional
per-contact allocation for the non-sticky path is the ``_prev_sorted_keys``
buffer (8 bytes/contact) since the sorter's key buffer is overwritten by
``_prepare_sort`` each frame.

Sticky mode needs one extra dedicated buffer (``_prev_normal_sticky``,
12 bytes/contact) because :meth:`replay_matched` runs **after**
``sort_full``, at which point the sorter's ``scratch_normal`` has been
clobbered by the sort's backup pass and no longer contains the previous
frame's sorted normals.  The body-frame point/offset columns already use
dedicated sticky buffers for the same reason.

Per-frame call order (inside :class:`~newton.CollisionPipeline`)::

    matcher.match(...)  # before ContactSorter.sort_full()
    sorter.sort_full(...)  # match_index is permuted with contacts
    matcher.replay_matched(...)  # sticky-only; overwrite matched rows
    matcher.build_report(...)  # optional; must precede save_sorted_state
    matcher.save_sorted_state(...)  # after sorting, replay, and report

The ordering matters: ``save_sorted_state`` overwrites ``_prev_count`` with
the current frame's count, while ``build_report`` reads the *old*
``_prev_count`` to bound the broken-contact enumeration, and sticky
``replay_matched`` must see the post-sort ``match_index`` and the pre-save
``_prev_*`` buffers it reads from.

        tie-break (smallest wins).  Using the sort key (rather than the
        unsorted thread id) keeps the resolution invariant under
        non-deterministic narrow-phase slot assignment: two new contacts
        racing for the same prev contact get the same packed claim
        regardless of which unsorted slot the narrow phase happened to
        hand them this run.

    Within a single shape pair the upper 40 bits of every contact's sort
    key are identical, so the low 32 bits hold the (shape_b LSBs +
    sort_sub_key) which uniquely identifies each contact in the pair as
    long as ``sort_sub_key`` is unique per contact within the pair.

    Note this is a *shared* assumption with the deterministic radix sort
    upstream, not a hard guarantee enforced by it.  The multi-contact
    and mesh/SDF paths build ``sort_sub_key`` from per-contact identifiers
    (clip-vertex slot, triangle/edge/vertex index) that are unique per
    pair by construction, but the reduced-contact path
    (``contact_reduction_global.export_reduced_contacts_kernel``)
    re-uses the original contact's fingerprint as ``sort_sub_key`` and
    only deduplicates by ``contact_id``, so two reduced contacts in the
    same pair can in principle land in different reduction slots and
    still share a fingerprint.  When that happens the deterministic
    sort and this tiebreak degrade together: the contacts are
    indistinguishable to either, and frame-to-frame matching becomes
    order-sensitive only to the same extent the sort itself does.  In
    other words, this scheme is no worse than what the upstream sort
    already provides.

# ContactMatcher class
# ------------------------------------------------------------------


class ContactMatcher:
    """Frame-to-frame contact matching using binary search on sorted keys.

    Internal helper owned by :class:`~newton.CollisionPipeline`.  All user-visible
    results (match index, new/broken index lists) are surfaced on the
    :class:`~newton.Contacts` container; this class only owns cross-frame state.

    Pre-allocates all buffers at construction time for CUDA graph capture
    compatibility.  See the module docstring for the per-frame call order and
    the ordering constraints between :meth:`match`, :meth:`replay_matched`,
    :meth:`build_report`, and :meth:`save_sorted_state`.

    Memory is minimised by reusing the sorter's existing scratch buffers for
    the previous-frame world-space contact midpoints and normals.  The matcher
    owns two small per-contact buffers in addition: the sorted key cache
    (8 bytes/contact) and the per-prev claim word used by the ``atomic_min``
    race that keeps new→prev injective (8 bytes/contact).  When
    ``contact_report`` is disabled, the ``prev_was_matched`` flag array is
    also skipped.

    .. note::
        Previous-frame state persists across :meth:`~newton.CollisionPipeline.collide`
        calls — that is the whole point.  In RL-style workflows where the user
        resets or teleports bodies between episodes, call :meth:`reset` after
        such discontinuities so the next frame starts fresh with all
        :data:`MATCH_NOT_FOUND`.

    Args:
        capacity: Maximum number of contacts (must match :class:`ContactSorter`).
        sorter: The :class:`ContactSorter` whose scratch buffers will be
            reused for storing previous-frame positions and normals.
        pos_threshold: World-space distance threshold [m] between the
            previous and current contact midpoints
            ``0.5 * (world(point0) + world(point1))``.  Contacts whose midpoint
            moved more than this between frames are considered broken.
        normal_dot_threshold: Minimum dot product between old and new contact
            normals.  Below this the contact is considered broken.
        contact_report: Allocate the ``prev_was_matched`` flag array needed
            to enumerate broken contacts in :meth:`build_report`.
        sticky: Allocate five extra per-contact ``wp.vec3`` buffers
            (``point0``/``point1``/``offset0``/``offset1`` body-frame, plus a
            dedicated ``normal`` buffer) used by :meth:`replay_matched`.  The
            world-frame normal needs its own allocation because sticky replay
            runs after ``ContactSorter.sort_full`` has clobbered the
            ``scratch_normal`` alias the match kernel reads pre-sort.  When
            ``False`` these attributes are ``None`` and no extra kernel
            launches are added.
