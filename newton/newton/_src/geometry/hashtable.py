"""GPU-friendly hash table for concurrent key-to-index mapping.

This module provides a generic hash table that maps keys to entry indices.
It is designed for GPU kernels where many threads insert concurrently.

Key features:
- Thread-safe insertion using atomic compare-and-swap
- Active entry tracking for efficient clearing
- Power-of-two capacity for fast modulo via bitwise AND

The hash table does NOT store values - it only maps keys to entry indices.
Callers can use these indices to access their own value storage.

# Note on uint64 constants: HASHTABLE_EMPTY_KEY and HASH_MIX_MULTIPLIER are
# defined with wp.uint64() at module scope rather than cast inside kernels.
# When a literal is cast inside a @wp.kernel or @wp.func (e.g., wp.uint64(x)),
# Warp first creates an intermediate variable with an incorrect type (signed),
# then casts to the target type. Defining the typed value at global scope and
# referencing it directly in kernels avoids this intermediate.
# On CPU builds, users may still see: "warning: integer literal is too large to
# be represented in a signed integer type, interpreting as unsigned". This is
# benign—no truncation or data loss occurs.
