"""Texture-based (tex3d) sparse SDF construction and sampling.

This module provides a GPU-accelerated sparse SDF implementation using 3D CUDA textures.
Construction mirrors the NanoVDB sparse-volume pattern in ``sdf_utils.py``:

1. Check subgrid occupancy by querying mesh SDF at subgrid centers
2. Build background/coarse SDF by querying mesh at subgrid corner positions
3. Populate only occupied subgrid textures by querying mesh at each texel

The format uses:
- A coarse 3D texture for background/far-field sampling
- A packed subgrid 3D texture for narrow-band high-resolution sampling
- An indirection array mapping coarse cells to subgrid blocks

Sampling uses analytical trilinear gradient computation from 8 corner texel reads,
providing exact accuracy with only 8 texture reads (vs 56 for finite differences).

# SDF texture-sampling paths
# ============================================================================
#
# Two pairs of trilinear samplers are provided -- pick at the call site:
#
# * :func:`texture_sample_sdf` / :func:`texture_sample_sdf_grad` --
#   ``"software"`` path. 8 point-sampled corner reads + float32 trilinear
#   blend. Most accurate; avoids the 8-bit fixed-point interpolation weights
#   the texture unit's hardware filter uses. Default for hydroelastic
#   contact, where contact-force precision feeds back into the stress
#   integration over the volume.
#
# * :func:`texture_sample_sdf_hw` / :func:`texture_sample_sdf_grad_hw` --
#   ``"hardware"`` path. One ``wp.texture_sample`` for the value, six
#   centred-difference samples for the gradient. Far fewer texture fetches
#   per query in principle; routes everything through the GPU's filter unit
#   (8-bit fixed-point interpolation weights). Used by the mesh-SDF
#   narrow phase, where the small extra jitter is absorbed by PGS.
#
# Both paths read from the same underlying ``LINEAR``-filtered textures
# (sampling at ``int + 0.5`` resolves to the exact texel value under any
# filter mode), so the choice only affects the kernel that inlines the
# sampler.

        winding_threshold: winding number threshold for inside/outside classification.
