<strong>⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️ </strong>

`SolverKamino` is currently in BETA (`BETA 1`).

At present time we discourage users of Newton from depending on it.

Similarly, and due to limited bandwidth of the development team, we will NOT be accepting contributions from the community.

A more stable `BETA 2` version is planned for release during the summer of 2026.

## Introduction

`SolverKamino` is a physics solver for simulating arbitrary mechanical assemblies that may feature kinematic loops and under-/overactuation.

It currently supports:
- Constrained rigid multi-body systems with arbitrary joint topologies (i.e. a kinematic tree is not assumed)
- A large set of common and advanced bilateral joint constraints
- Unilateral joint-limit and contact constraints with spatial friction and restitutive impacts
- Fully configurable constraint stabilization that can be specified per constraint subset
- Hard joint-limit and contact constraints enforced via an advanced Proximal-ADMM forward dynamics solver

Kamino is being developed and maintained by [Disney Research](https://www.disneyresearch.com/) in collaboration with [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/) and [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/).


## Getting Started

### Installing

For plain users, the official [installation instructions](https://newton-physics.github.io/newton/latest/guide/installation.html) of Newton are recommended.

For developers, please refer to the [Development](#development) section below.


### Running Examples

A set of examples is provided in `newton/_src/solvers/kamino/examples`.

These can be run directly as stand-alone scripts, for example:
```bash
cd newton/_src/solvers/kamino/examples
python sim/example_sim_dr_legs.py
```

All examples will eventually be migrated, and integrated, into the main set of examples provided in Newton located in `newton/examples`.


### Running Unit Tests

```bash
cd newton/_src/solvers/kamino/tests
python -m unittest discover -s . -p 'test_*.py'
```

Please refer to the [Unit Tests](./tests/README.md) `README.md` for further instructions for how to run unit tests using IDEs such as VS Code.

All tests will eventually be migrated, and integrated, into the main set of unit-tests provided in Newton located in `newton/tests`.

## Development

Development of Kamino requires the installation of [Newton](https://github.com/newton-physics/newton) from source and the latest version of [Warp](https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp) either through nightly builds or also from source.

The first step involves setting-up a python environment.

The simplest is to create a new `virtualenv`. Alternatively one could
follow the [instructions](https://newton-physics.github.io/newton/latest/guide/installation.html) from Newton.

### Virtual environments using `pyenv`
Because we're working on a fork of the main Newton repository, it can be useful to create two `virtualenv|conda|uv` environments.

Using `pyenv` and `virtualenv` it would look something like this:
- one for development of Kamino within our fork
```bash
pyenv virtualenv newton
pyenv activate newton
pip install -U pip
```

A similar setup can be achieved via `conda|uv`. We've used the `*-dev` suffix to denote environments were the packages will be installed from source, while this can be omitted when creating environments to test installations when installing from `pip` wheels.


### APT (Only Required for Linux)
On Linux platforms, e.g. Ubuntu, the following base APT packages must be installed:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
```

### MuJoCo
The first `pip` package to install is MuJoCo:
```bash
pip install mujoco --pre -f https://py.mujoco.org/
```

**NOTE**:
This must be installed first as it will pull the required version of foundational dependencies such as `numpy`.


### Warp
Nightly builds of Warp can be installed using:
```bash
pip install warp-lang --pre -U -f https://pypi.nvidia.com/warp-lang/
```

Alternatively, Warp can be installed from source (recommended) using:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:NVIDIA/warp.git
cd warp
python build_lib.py
pip install -e .[dev,benchmark]
```

**NOTE**:
Many new features and fixes in Warp that are requested by Newton developers come quite often, so keeping up to date with Warp `main` can prove useful.


### MuJoCo Warp
MuJoCo Warp (a.k.a. MJWarp) can be installed from source using:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_warp.git@main
```

For development purposes, it can also be installed explicitly with optional dependencies from source using:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:google-deepmind/mujoco_warp.git
cd mujoco_warp
pip install -e .[dev,cuda]
```


### Newton
Newton needs to be installed from source for Kamino development using:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:newton-physics/newton-usd-schemas.git
cd newton-usd-schemas
pip install -e .[dev,docs,notebook]
```
```bash
git clone git@github.com:newton-physics/newton.git
cd newton
pip install -e .[dev,docs,notebook]
```
