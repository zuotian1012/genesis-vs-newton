Proximal-ADMM Solver

Provides a forward dynamics solver for constrained rigid multi-body systems using
the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). This implementation realizes
the Proximal-ADMM algorithm described in [1] and is based on the work of J. Carpentier
et al in [2]. It solves the Lagrange dual of the constrained forward dynamics problem
in constraint reactions (i.e. impulses) and post-event constraint-space velocities. The
diagonal preconditioner strategy described in [3] is also implemented to improve
numerical conditioning. This version also incorporates Nesterov-style gradient
acceleration with adaptive restarts based on the work of O'Donoghue and Candes in [4].

Notes
----
- ADMM is based on the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) for dealing with set-inclusion
  (i.e. inequality) constraints, but introduces an alternating primal-dual descent/ascent scheme.
- Proximal-ADMM introduces an additional proximal regularization term to the optimization objective.
- Uses (optional) Nesterov-style gradient acceleration with adaptive restarts.
- Uses (optional) adaptive penalty updates based on primal-dual residual balancing.

Usage
----
A typical example for using this module is:

    # Import all relevant types from Kamino
    from newton._src.solvers.kamino.core import ModelBuilderKamino
    from newton._src.solvers.kamino._src.geometry import ContactsKamino
    from newton._src.solvers.kamino._src.kinematics import LimitsKamino
    from newton._src.solvers.kamino._src.kinematics import DenseSystemJacobians
    from newton._src.solvers.kamino._src.dynamics import DualProblem
    from newton._src.solvers.kamino.solvers import PADMMSolver

    # Create a model builder and add bodies, joints, geoms, etc.
    builder = ModelBuilderKamino()
    ...

    # Create a model from the builder and construct additional
    # containers to hold joint-limits, contacts, Jacobians
    model = builder.finalize()
    data = model.data()
    limits = LimitsKamino(model)
    contacts = ContactsKamino(builder)
    jacobians = DenseSystemJacobians(model, limits, contacts)

    # Build the Jacobians for the model and active limits and contacts
    jacobians.build(model, data, limits, contacts)
    ...

    # Create a forward-dynamics DualProblem to be solved
    dual = DualProblem(model, limits, contacts, jacobians)
    dual.build(model, data, limits, contacts, jacobians)

    # Create a forward-dynamics PADMM solver
    solver = PADMMSolver(model, limits, contacts)

    # Solve the dual forward dynamics problem
    solver.coldstart()
    solver.solve(problem=dual)

    # Extract the resulting constraint reactions
    multipliers = solver.solution.lambdas
