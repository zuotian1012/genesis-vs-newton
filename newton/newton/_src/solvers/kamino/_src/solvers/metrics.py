Provides a utilities to compute performance metrics that
assess physical plausibility and accuracy of simulations.


The :class:`SolutionMetricsData` class defines the set of simulation solver performance metrics that
provide quantitative measures of constraint satisfaction and physical plausibility of the computed
solution to the dual forward-dynamics Nonlinear Complementarity Problem (NCP).

The :class:`SolutionMetrics` class provides a high-level interface to manage all relevant data
allocations as well as provide the operations to compute the various performance metrics.
