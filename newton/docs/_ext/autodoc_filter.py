    We apply two simple rules that make API pages cleaner:
    1.   Private helpers (names that start with an underscore but are not
         special dunder methods) are hidden unless they are explicitly
         marked as public via a ``:meta public:`` field.
    2.   Public members that have **no** docstring are hidden.  This keeps the
         generated documentation focused on the public, documented API.

    Returning ``True`` tells Sphinx to skip the member, ``False`` to include
    it, and ``None`` to fall back to Sphinx's default behaviour.
