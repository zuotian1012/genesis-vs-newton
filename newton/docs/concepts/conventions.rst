Conventions
===========

This document covers the various conventions used across physics engines and graphics frameworks when working with Newton and other simulation systems.

Primer: Reference Points for Rigid-Body Spatial Force and Velocity
------------------------------------------------------------------

Newton uses rigid-body spatial forces (wrenches) and velocities (twists) in its API. These spatial vectors are defined with respect to a **reference point**.
When shifting the reference point, the force and velocity are updated in order to preserve the effect of the wrench, and the velocity field described by the twist, with respect to the new reference point.
The 6D wrench and twist are composed of a linear and an angular 3D-vector component, and in the context of these spatial vectors, their reference-point dependence is as follows:

- **Point-independent components**: linear force :math:`\mathbf{f}`, angular velocity :math:`\boldsymbol{\omega}`.
- **Point-dependent components**: angular torque (moment) :math:`\boldsymbol{\tau}`, linear velocity :math:`\mathbf{v}`.

Shifting the reference point by :math:`\mathbf{r} = (\mathbf{p}_{\text{new}} - \mathbf{p}_{\text{old}})` changes the point-dependent vector components as follows:

.. math::

   \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{new}} = \boldsymbol{\tau} + \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{f}, \qquad
   \mathbf{v}_{\text{new}} = \mathbf{v} + \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}.

Keep this distinction in mind below: In addition to the coordinate frame that wrenches and twists are expressed in,
Newton documentation states the **reference point** that it expects. If you compute e.g. a wrench with respect to a different reference point, you must shift it to the expected reference point.

Spatial Twist Conventions
--------------------------

Twists in Modern Robotics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In robotics, a **twist** is a 6-dimensional velocity vector combining angular
and linear velocity. *Modern Robotics* (Lynch & Park) defines two equivalent
representations of a rigid body's twist, depending on the coordinate frame
used:

* **Body twist** (:math:`V_b`):
  uses the body's *body frame* (often at the body's center of mass).
  Here :math:`\omega_b` is the angular velocity expressed in the body frame,
  and :math:`v_b` is the linear velocity of a point at the body origin
  (e.g. the COM) expressed in the body frame.  
  Thus :math:`V_b = (\omega_b,\;v_b)` gives the body's own-frame view of its
  motion.

* **Spatial twist** (:math:`V_s`):
  uses the fixed *space frame* (world/inertial frame).
  :math:`v_s` represents the linear velocity of a hypothetical point on the
  moving body that is instantaneously at the world origin, and
  :math:`\omega_s` is the angular velocity expressed in world coordinates.  Equivalently,

  .. math::

     v_s \;=\; \dot p \;-\; \omega_s \times p,

  where :math:`p` is the vector from the world origin to the body origin.
  Hence :math:`V_s = (v_s,\;\omega_s)` is called the **spatial twist**.
  *Note:* :math:`v_s` is **not** simply the COM velocity
  (that would be :math:`\dot p`); it is the velocity of the *world origin* as
  if rigidly attached to the body.

In summary, *Modern Robotics* lets us express the same physical motion either
in the body frame or in the world frame.  The angular velocity is identical
up to coordinate rotation; the linear component depends on the chosen
reference point (world origin vs. body origin).

Physics-Engine Conventions (Drake, MuJoCo, Isaac)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most physics engines store the **COM linear velocity** together with the
**angular velocity** of the body, typically both in world coordinates.  This
corresponds conceptually to a twist taken at the COM and expressed in the
world frame, though details vary:

* **Drake**  
  Drake's multibody library uses full spatial vectors with explicit frame
  names.  The default, :math:`V_{MB}^{E}`, reads "velocity of frame *B*
  measured in frame *M*, expressed in frame *E*."  In normal use
  :math:`V_{WB}^{W}` (body *B* in world *W*, expressed in *W*) contains
  :math:`(\omega_{WB}^{W},\;v_{WB_o}^{W})`, i.e. both components in the world
  frame.  This aligns with the usual physics-engine convention.

* **MuJoCo**  
  MuJoCo employs a *mixed-frame* format for free bodies:  
  the linear part :math:`(v_x,v_y,v_z)` is the velocity of the **body frame
  origin** (i.e., where ``qpos[0:3]`` is located) in the world frame, while the
  angular part :math:`(\omega_x,\omega_y,\omega_z)` is expressed in the **body
  frame**.  The choice follows from quaternion integration (angular velocities
  "live" in the quaternion's tangent space, a local frame).  Note that when the
  body's center of mass (``body_ipos``) is offset from the body frame origin,
  the linear velocity is *not* the CoM velocity—see :ref:`MuJoCo conversion <MuJoCo conversion>`
  below for the relationship.

* **Isaac Lab / Isaac Gym**  
  NVIDIA's Isaac tools provide **both** linear and angular velocities in the
  world frame.  The root-state tensor returns
  :math:`(v_x,v_y,v_z,\;\omega_x,\omega_y,\omega_z)` all expressed globally.
  This matches Bullet/ODE/PhysX practice.

.. _Twist conventions:

Newton Conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Newton** follows the standard physics engine convention for most solvers,
aligning with Isaac Lab's approach.
Newton's public ``spatial_vector`` arrays use ``(linear, angular)`` ordering,
unlike Warp's native ``(angular, linear)`` convention. This applies to arrays
such as :attr:`newton.State.body_qd` and :attr:`newton.State.body_f`.
Newton's :attr:`State.body_qd <newton.State.body_qd>` stores **both** linear and angular velocities
in the world frame.

.. code-block:: python

  @wp.kernel
  def get_body_twist(body_qd: wp.array[wp.spatial_vector]):
    body_id = wp.tid()
    # body_qd is a 6D wp.spatial_vector in world frame
    twist = body_qd[body_id]
    # linear velocity is the velocity of the body's center of mass in world frame
    linear_velocity = twist[0:3]
    # angular velocity is the angular velocity of the body in world frame
    angular_velocity = twist[3:6]

  wp.launch(get_body_twist, dim=model.body_count, inputs=[state.body_qd])


The linear velocity represents the COM velocity in world
coordinates, while the angular velocity is also expressed in world coordinates.
This matches the Isaac Lab convention exactly. Note that Newton will automatically
convert from this convention to MuJoCo's mixed-frame format when using the
SolverMuJoCo, including both the angular velocity frame conversion (world ↔ body)
and the linear velocity reference point conversion (CoM ↔ body frame origin).

If you need the velocity of the body-frame origin rather than the COM, shift the
linear term by the body's COM offset in world coordinates:

.. math::

   v_{\text{origin}}^W = v_{\text{com}}^W - \omega^W \times r_{\text{com}}^W.

Mapping Between Representations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Body ↔ Spatial (Modern Robotics)**  
For body pose :math:`T_{sb}=(R,p)`:

.. math::

   \omega_s \;=\; R\,\omega_b,
   \qquad
   v_s \;=\; R\,v_b \;+\; \omega_s \times p.

This is :math:`V_s = \mathrm{Ad}_{(R,p)}\,V_b`;
the inverse uses :math:`R^{\mathsf T}` and :math:`-R^{\mathsf T}p`.

**Physics engine → MR**  
Given engine values :math:`(v_{\text{com}}^{W},\;\omega^{W})`
(world-frame COM velocity and angular velocity):

1. Spatial twist at COM  

   :math:`V_{WB}^{W} = (v_{\text{com}}^{W},\;\omega^{W})`

2. Body-frame twist  

   :math:`\omega_b = R^{\mathsf T}\omega^{W}`,
   :math:`v_b = R^{\mathsf T}v_{\text{com}}^{W}`.

3. Shift to another origin offset :math:`r` from COM:  

   :math:`v_{\text{origin}}^{W} = v_{\text{com}}^{W} + \omega^{W}\times r^{W}`,
   where :math:`r^{W}=R\,r`.

.. _MuJoCo conversion:

**MuJoCo conversion**  
Two conversions are needed between Newton and MuJoCo:

1. **Angular velocity frame**: Rotate MuJoCo's body-frame angular velocity by
   :math:`R` to obtain the world-frame angular velocity (or vice versa):

   .. math::

      \omega^{W} = R\,\omega^{B}, \qquad \omega^{B} = R^{\mathsf T}\omega^{W}

2. **Linear velocity reference point**: MuJoCo's linear velocity is at the
   body frame origin, while Newton uses the CoM velocity.  When the body has a
   non-zero CoM offset :math:`r` (``body_ipos`` in MuJoCo, ``body_com`` in
   Newton), convert using:

   .. math::

      v_{\text{origin}}^{W} = v_{\text{com}}^{W} - \omega^{W} \times r^{W},
      \qquad
      v_{\text{com}}^{W} = v_{\text{origin}}^{W} + \omega^{W} \times r^{W}

   where :math:`r^{W} = R\,r^{B}` is the CoM offset expressed in world coordinates.

In all cases the conversion boils down to the **reference point**
(COM vs. another point) and the **frame** (world vs. body) used for each
component.  Physics is unchanged; any linear velocity at one point follows
:math:`v_{\text{new}} = v + \omega\times r`.


Spatial Wrench Conventions
--------------------------

Newton represents external rigid-body forces as **spatial wrenches** in
:attr:`State.body_f <newton.State.body_f>`. The 6D wrench is stored in world
frame as:

.. math::

   \mathbf{w} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{f} \\ \boldsymbol{\tau} \end{bmatrix},

where :math:`\mathbf{f}` is the **linear force** and :math:`\boldsymbol{\tau}`
is the **moment about the body's center of mass (COM)**, both expressed in
world coordinates. The reference point matters for the moment term, so shifting
the wrench to a point offset by :math:`\mathbf{r}` changes the torque as:

.. math::

   \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{new}} = \boldsymbol{\tau} + \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{f}.

This convention is used in all Newton solvers.

The array of joint forces (torques) in generalized coordinates is stored in :attr:`Control.joint_f <newton.Control.joint_f>`.
For ``FREE`` and ``DISTANCE`` joints, the corresponding 6 dimensions in this
array are the physical wrench in world coordinates, with the force and torque
referenced at the child body's center of mass (COM).

.. note::

  MuJoCo represents root free-joint generalized forces in a mixed-frame convention in ``qfrc_applied``. To preserve Newton's
  COM-wrench semantics for that root-free-joint case, :class:`~newton.solvers.SolverMuJoCo` applies free-joint
  :attr:`Control.joint_f <newton.Control.joint_f>` through ``xfrc_applied`` (world-frame wrench at the COM) and
  uses ``qfrc_applied`` only for non-free joints. This keeps free-joint ``joint_f`` behavior aligned with
  :attr:`State.body_f <newton.State.body_f>`.

  We avoid converting free-joint wrenches into ``qfrc_applied`` directly because ``qfrc_applied`` is **generalized-force
  space**, not a physical wrench. For free joints the 6-DOF basis depends on the current ``cdof`` (subtree COM frame),
  and the rotational components are expressed in the body frame. A naive world-to-body rotation is insufficient because
  the correct mapping is the Jacobian-transpose operation used internally by MuJoCo (the same path as ``xfrc_applied``).
  Routing through ``xfrc_applied`` ensures the wrench is interpreted at the COM in world coordinates and then mapped to
  generalized forces consistently with MuJoCo's own dynamics.

Quaternion Ordering Conventions
--------------------------------

Different physics engines and graphics frameworks use different conventions 
for storing quaternion components. This can cause significant confusion when 
transferring data between systems or when interfacing with external libraries.

The quaternion :math:`q = w + xi + yj + zk` where :math:`w` is the scalar 
(real) part and :math:`(x, y, z)` is the vector (imaginary) part, can be 
stored in memory using different orderings:

.. list-table:: Quaternion Component Ordering
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 35 35

   * - **System**
     - **Storage Order**
     - **Description**
   * - **Newton / Warp**
     - ``(x, y, z, w)``
     - Vector part first, scalar last
   * - **Isaac Lab / Isaac Sim**
     - ``(w, x, y, z)``
     - Scalar first, vector part last
   * - **MuJoCo**
     - ``(w, x, y, z)``
     - Scalar first, vector part last
   * - **USD (Universal Scene Description)**
     - ``(x, y, z, w)``
     - Vector part first, scalar last

**Important Notes:**

* **Mathematical notation** typically writes quaternions as :math:`q = w + xi + yj + zk` 
  or :math:`q = (w, x, y, z)`, but this doesn't dictate storage order.

* **Conversion between systems** requires careful attention to component ordering.
  For example, converting from Isaac Lab to Newton requires reordering:
  ``newton_quat = (isaac_quat[1], isaac_quat[2], isaac_quat[3], isaac_quat[0])``

* **Rotation semantics** remain the same regardless of storage order—only the 
  memory layout differs.

* **Warp's quat type** uses ``(x, y, z, w)`` ordering, accessible via:
  ``quat[0]`` (x), ``quat[1]`` (y), ``quat[2]`` (z), ``quat[3]`` (w).

When working with multiple systems, always verify quaternion ordering in your 
data pipeline to avoid unexpected rotations or orientations.

Coordinate System and Up Axis Conventions
------------------------------------------

Different physics engines, graphics frameworks, and content creation tools use 
different conventions for coordinate systems and up axis orientation. This can 
cause significant confusion when transferring assets between systems or when 
setting up physics simulations from existing content.

The **up axis** determines which coordinate axis points "upward" in the world, 
affecting gravity direction, object placement, and overall scene orientation.

.. list-table:: Coordinate System and Up Axis Conventions
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 20 25 25

   * - **System**
     - **Up Axis**
     - **Handedness**
     - **Notes**
   * - **Newton**
     - ``Z`` (default)
     - Right-handed
     - Configurable via ``Axis.X/Y/Z``
   * - **MuJoCo**
     - ``Z`` (default)
     - Right-handed
     - Standard robotics convention
   * - **USD**
     - ``Y`` (default)
     - Right-handed
     - Configurable as ``Y`` or ``Z``
   * - **Isaac Lab / Isaac Sim**
     - ``Z`` (default)
     - Right-handed
     - Follows robotics conventions

**Important Design Principle:**

Newton itself is **coordinate system agnostic** and can work with any choice 
of up axis. The physics calculations and algorithms do not depend on a specific 
coordinate system orientation. However, it becomes essential to track the 
conventions used by various assets and data sources to enable proper conversion 
and integration at runtime.

**Common Integration Scenarios:**

* **USD to Newton**: Convert from USD's Y-up (or Z-up) to Newton's configured up axis
* **MuJoCo to Newton**: Convert from MuJoCo's Z-up to Newton's configured up axis  
* **Mixed asset pipelines**: Track up axis per asset and apply appropriate transforms

**Conversion Between Systems:**

When converting assets between coordinate systems with different up axes, 
apply the appropriate rotation transforms:

* **Y-up ↔ Z-up**: 90° rotation around the X-axis
* **Maintain right-handedness**: Ensure coordinate system handedness is preserved

**Example Configuration:**

.. code-block:: python

   import newton
   
   # Configure Newton for Z-up coordinate system (robotics convention)
   builder = newton.ModelBuilder(up_axis=newton.Axis.Z, gravity=-9.81)
   
   # Or use Y-up (graphics/animation convention)  
   builder = newton.ModelBuilder(up_axis=newton.Axis.Y, gravity=-9.81)
   
   # Gravity vector will automatically align with the chosen up axis:
   # - Y-up: gravity = (0, -9.81, 0)
   # - Z-up: gravity = (0, 0, -9.81)

Color Space Handling
--------------------

Newton treats authored surface colors as display/sRGB RGB values by default.
Public color inputs such as :attr:`newton.Model.shape_color`,
:attr:`newton.Mesh.color`, and the ``color`` arguments on
:class:`newton.ModelBuilder` shape helpers should be passed as the values you
want to see on screen, with components in ``[0, 1]``.

Rendering backends convert authored display colors to linear light for shading.
In other words, do not pre-linearize shape or mesh colors before assigning them
to Newton. When you need linear-light math explicitly, convert at the boundary
with :func:`newton.utils.color_srgb_to_linear` and
:func:`newton.utils.color_linear_to_srgb`.

.. code-block:: python

   import newton

   display_color = (0.125, 0.125, 0.15)

   builder = newton.ModelBuilder()
   builder.add_ground_plane(color=display_color)

   linear_color = newton.utils.color_srgb_to_linear(display_color)

Base-color textures stored on Newton models follow the same convention and are
kept display/sRGB-encoded.

Packed color and albedo outputs from :class:`newton.sensors.SensorTiledCamera`
use display/sRGB encoding by default. Set
``SensorTiledCamera.RenderConfig(output_color_space=newton.utils.ColorSpace.LINEAR)``
when linear RGB bytes are required for downstream processing. Clear colors are
specified as display/sRGB packed RGBA values and are converted to linear when
linear output is requested.

Collision Primitive Conventions
-------------------------------

This section documents the conventions used for collision primitive shapes in Newton and compares them with other physics engines and formats. Understanding these conventions is essential when:

* Creating collision geometry programmatically with ModelBuilder
* Debugging unexpected collision behavior after asset import
* Understanding center of mass calculations for asymmetric shapes

Newton Collision Primitives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Newton defines collision primitives with consistent conventions across all shape types. The following table summarizes the key parameters and properties for each primitive:

     - Edges aligned with local axes

     - Uniform in all directions
   * - **Capsule**

   * - **Cylinder**
     - Geometric center
     - ``radius``, ``half_height``
     - Extends along Z-axis
   * - **Cone**
     - Geometric center
     - ``radius`` (base), ``half_height``
     - Extends along Z-axis; base at -half_height, apex at +half_height
   * - **Plane**
     - Shape frame origin
     - ``width``, ``length`` (or 0,0 for infinite)
     - Normal along +Z of shape frame
   * - **Mesh**
     - User-defined
     - Vertex and triangle arrays
     - General triangle mesh (can be non-convex); CCW winding defines outward face normal

**Shape Orientation and Alignment**

All Newton primitives that have a primary axis (capsule, cylinder, cone) are aligned along the Z-axis in their local coordinate frame. The shape's transform determines its final position and orientation in the world or parent body frame.

**Center of Mass Considerations**

For most primitives, the center of mass coincides with the geometric origin. The cone is a notable exception:

* **Cone COM**: Located at ``(0, 0, -half_height/2)`` in the shape's local frame, which is 1/4 of the total height from the base toward the apex.

Import Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Newton's importers automatically handle convention differences when loading assets. No manual conversion is required when using these importers—they automatically transform shapes to Newton's conventions.
