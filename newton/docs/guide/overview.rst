**Newton** is a GPU-accelerated, extensible, and differentiable physics simulation engine designed for robotics, research, and advanced simulation workflows. Built on top of NVIDIA Warp and integrating MuJoCo Warp, Newton provides high-performance simulation, modern Python APIs, and a flexible architecture for both users and developers.


Key Features
------------

* **GPU-accelerated**: Leverages NVIDIA Warp for fast, scalable simulation.
* **Multiple solver implementations**: XPBD, VBD, MuJoCo, Featherstone,
  SemiImplicit, Kamino, ImplicitMPM, and Style3D.
* **Modular design**: Easily extendable with new solvers and components.
* **Differentiable**: Supports differentiable simulation for machine learning and optimization.
* **Rich Import/Export**: Load models from URDF, MJCF, USD, and more.
* **Open Source**: Maintained by Disney Research, Google DeepMind, and NVIDIA.

- :class:`~newton.ModelBuilder`: The entry point for constructing
  simulation models from primitives or imported assets.
- :class:`~newton.Model`: Encapsulates the physical structure,
  parameters, and configuration of the simulation world, including
  bodies, joints, shapes, and physical properties.
- :class:`~newton.State`: Represents the dynamic state at a given time,
  including positions and velocities that solvers update each step.
  Optional :doc:`extended attributes <../concepts/extended_attributes>`
  store derived quantities such as rigid-body accelerations for
  sensors.
- :class:`~newton.Contacts`: Stores the active contact set produced by
  :meth:`Model.collide <newton.Model.collide>`, with optional extended
  attributes such as contact forces for sensing and analysis.
- :class:`~newton.Control`: Encodes control inputs such as joint targets
  and forces applied during the simulation loop.
- :doc:`Solver </solvers/index>`: Advances the simulation by
  integrating physics, handling contacts, and enforcing constraints.
  Newton provides multiple solver backends, including XPBD, VBD,
  MuJoCo, Featherstone, SemiImplicit, Kamino, ImplicitMPM, and Style3D.
- :doc:`Sensors <../concepts/sensors>`: Compute observations from
  :class:`~newton.State`, :class:`~newton.Contacts`, sites, and shapes.
  Many sensors rely on optional :doc:`extended attributes
  <../concepts/extended_attributes>` that store derived solver outputs.
- **Importer**: Loads models from external formats via
  :meth:`~newton.ModelBuilder.add_urdf`,
  :meth:`~newton.ModelBuilder.add_mjcf`, and
  :meth:`~newton.ModelBuilder.add_usd`.
- :doc:`Viewer <visualization>`: Visualizes the simulation in real time
  or offline.

Simulation Loop
---------------

1. Build or import a model with :class:`~newton.ModelBuilder`.
2. Finalize the builder into a :class:`~newton.Model`.
3. Create any sensors, then allocate one or more
   :class:`~newton.State` objects plus :class:`~newton.Control` inputs
   and :class:`~newton.Contacts`.
4. Call :meth:`Model.collide <newton.Model.collide>` to populate the
   contact set for the current state.
5. Step a :doc:`solver </solvers/index>` using the current
   state, control, and contacts.
6. Update sensors, inspect outputs, render, or export the results.
